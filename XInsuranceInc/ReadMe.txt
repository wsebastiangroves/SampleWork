X Insurance Inc. Summary
******

This company generates and purchases 'leads' who hopefully have some interest in getting a quote from an insurance agency. Insurance agencies pay for X Insurance Inc. for transferring leads to them (via phone call) who are qualified and ready to complete the quote process at that moment in their day. 

Customers get to skip talking to a machine and not knowing which agencies to contact for a quote, since X Insurance Company Inc. has a system which pre-qualifies them across a list of over a dozen agencies.

Dialers work either on-site or remotely for X Insurance Company Inc. They simply dial a lead, confirm a short list of information (or schedule a better time to talk), and send the lead to a qualifying agency.

Two 'agency types' exist, either a true agency with no further middleman, or another call center/company similar to X Insurance Company Inc. which will pay less for the lead. This is so X Insurance Company Inc. gets at least a few dollars out of buying a lead. This is less win for the customer.
