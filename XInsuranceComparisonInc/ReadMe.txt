X Insurance Company Inc.
******

This company generates and purchases 'leads'/'customers' who have interest in getting quotes from insurance agencies. Insurance agencies pay for this company for leads to be transferred, via phone call, who are qualified and ready to complete the quote process at that moment in their day. Customers get to skip talking to a machine and not knowing which agencies to contact for a quote, since X Insurance Company Inc. has a system which pre-qualifies them across a list of over a dozen agencies. It should be a win-win, mostly, for everyone.

Dialers work either on-site or remotely for X Insurance Company Inc. They simply dial a lead, confirm a short list of information (or schedule a better time to talk), and send the lead to a qualifying agency.

Two 'agency types' exist, either a true agency with no further middleman, or another call center/company similar to X Insurance Company Inc. which will pay less for the lead. This is so X Insurance Company Inc. gets at least a few dollars out of buying a lead. This is less win for the customer.
